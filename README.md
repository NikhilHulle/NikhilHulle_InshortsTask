This is Nikhil Hulle, applying for the post of software dev 
i have finished the task except setting up the swagger docs, i was finding it a little challenging to set it up, but i have attempted to write documentation in the each files for the ease of understanding......

I have currently not uploaded this to heroku, and will update this readme if i do it, other than that i have completed all the requirements to the best of my ability as i had to learn everything from scratch since i am a fresher.



There are 2 APIs here
1) API_CovidSTATS
2) API_LocationStats

To execute the task, follow the below procedure

1) clone the repo
2) run both the api using the command run ```go run cmd/server/main.go```
3) The API_CovidSTATS api runs on port 1453.
4) http://localhost:1453/location?lat=18.3817844&lng=77.11884189999999 --->  this is an example call to that api.
5) You will get a screen with the required information
